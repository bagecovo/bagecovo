# Hi everyone 
I am @bagecovo! I am a student who is learning programming on the side while finishing up my master in Chinese Studies. 


This page serves as a place to save my projects, as well as a portofolio for anyone interested. 
Over time I want te keep adding more projects that I am working on. Currently I am learning Python, with a special interest in Data Science and mathematics.
In the future I want to explore some more low level language programming languages like C++ or try my hands at learning Javascript and do more with web-development.

# Choosing a project
I choose my projects mainly based on my interests at that time. An ideal project for me challenges and pushes me to learn more about programming (or other academic) concepts.
These concepts should have some application in future projects, or develop my skill in programming overall. If the project also solves a real life problem, even better!
